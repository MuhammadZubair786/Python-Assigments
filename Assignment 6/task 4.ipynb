    "# Classes and Objects are basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming which revolve around the real life entities. Class. A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# In object-oriented programming (OOP), objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process. ... Each object is an instance of a particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Classes (OOP) In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). The user-defined objects are created using the class keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Attribute (computing) ... In computing, an attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such. For clarity, attributes should more correctly be considered metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are the functions and subroutines defined within the object class. Without class methods, a class would simply be a structure. Methods determine what type of functionality a class has, how it modifies its data, and its overall behavior\n"
